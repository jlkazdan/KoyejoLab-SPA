      You are participating in a simple task. You will see a random sequence of characters.
      After seeing it, you must choose exactly one letter: A, B, C, or D.  
      
      Here is a random sequence:
      {sequence}
      
      Now choose one option: (A), (B), (C), or (D). Output your answer as a single letter. 

      There should be NO OTHER LETTERS besides the single final letter.
